In this preview, I have taken a past project of mine which is layer 0 and added a black background. The past project is a piece I call 'American Warzone'. It was made to show injustice and was made for the black lives matters protests. I took the photo of the cops arresting the man at a protest. To portray my message better I added a mask broken in half to show both the pain being caused and the complacency that the United States demands from its inhabitants. I also added blood running down his face to emphasize the violence that has been wrongfully done. I also chose to include large bold white letters to emphasize the phrase american warzone. This was not made to provoke thoughts of war but how civilians are affected during a war and anything in war's path as that can be a solid analogy for how protesters have been treated. In the future I am going to add cop lights and then a burning car and buildings as well.
