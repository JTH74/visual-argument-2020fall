My goal was to create a piece of visual rhetoric that shows the blm movment. I call this piece "American Warzone" since it seems that america is a war currently for whats right and standing up for our own. The mask represents the U.S.'s want to keep civilians complacent under unfare treatment. This is also why I chose to split the mask in half and add blood on the left side. I also chose to add the black lives matter symbol to solidify the point as well as cop lights in the background.
